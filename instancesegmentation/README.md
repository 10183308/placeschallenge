# Instruction for the Scene Instance Segmentation

 Scene Instance Segmentation is to segment the image into object instances and stuff categories. The task is pixel-wise classification similarly to Task 1, but it requires the proposed algorithm to extract each object instance from the image while segment the full image. The motivation of this task is two folded: 1) Let the research of semantic segmentation move forwards to instance segmentation. 2) Let there be more synergy among the object detection, the semantic segmentation, and
 the scene parsing. The data will be based on the data of Task 1, but with the object instance annotations for each category. The evaluation metric is the combination of IoU and Average Precision over all the 150 visual concepts.
